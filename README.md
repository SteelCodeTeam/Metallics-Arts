## **Final Notes 🚀**

We're huge fans of Lego and blits works! We highly encourage you to visit their mod pages and give them a try!

And don't forget to read all of Brandon Sanderson's books. They're truly amazing reads.

We have big plans for the mod, but there are only a few people on the project, so bigger updates take a lot of time. 
We know we're going to port it to version 1.20.x, and we know we'll be adding single player features. **Please be patient!**
